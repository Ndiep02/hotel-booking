# hotel-booking
This is a personal project, which uses a real-world dataset about hotel booking domains. In addition, the main goal of this project is to answer several questions addressing the price optimization problem. Furthermore, I also explore booking trends over time, identify the most frequently booked room types, and propose potential additional services.
